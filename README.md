# Tamil to English Speech Translator  

A simple and efficient speech translation application that converts spoken Tamil language into English text or speech. This project utilizes advanced speech recognition and translation technologies to facilitate communication between Tamil and English speakers.  

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to [Dipsita Rout](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/)  for her invaluable assistance in the development of the English to Tamil speech translation feature and for conducting thorough testing, which greatly enhanced the project's quality.

## Features  

- Real-time speech translation from Tamil to English  
- Accurate speech recognition  
- User-friendly interface  
- Cross-platform compatibility  

## Installation

## Usage
1. Run the application:
   python app.py  
3. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 (or the specified port).

## Using the Application

1. Select the Language: Upon starting the application, you will have options to choose the source and target languages (Tamil to English or English to Tamil).


2. Speak for Translation: After selecting the languages, click the "Start" button to begin speaking.
Speak clearly into the microphone whatever you want to translate. If you are translating from Tamil to English, speak in Tamil; if translating from English to Tamil, speak in English.

3. Viewing Translated Text: As you speak, the application will process your speech and display the translated text in real-time on the screen.

4. Stopping the Translation:Once you have completed your speech, you can click the "Stop" button to end the translation session.


## Troubleshooting

1. Microphone Issues:
  If the application does not capture your voice, ensure your microphone is connected and functioning. Also, check your device settings to ensure the 
  microphone is allowed for applications.


2. Translation Errors:
   If you notice any inaccuracies in the translation, try speaking more clearly or adjust your speech pace. Background noise can also affect recognition
   accuracy.
